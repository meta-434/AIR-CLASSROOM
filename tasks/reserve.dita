  <title>Reserving a Classroom</title>
  <body>
    <p>The reservation process is as simple as possible. Once you've identified a space you want to rent, you simply have to click the green "Rent!" button on the right of the listing page. You'll immediately be brought to a payment option page, where you'll confirm the dates and times you entered when initially searching spaces, and be given the option to pay with either PayPal or Bitcoin. At this time, AirClassroom does not accept credit cards or checks.</p>
