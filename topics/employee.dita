    <p>For employees tasked with putting on a presentation or making a pitch, our spaces are a perfect fit. With the assembled help topics, you'll be able to ensure that you've got everything working perfectly so you can nail your presentation. We've got instructions on how to use the instructor computer and projector, and how to use the document camera. With these tools available in all of our AirClassroom spaces, there'll be to question about your preparedness and technical fluency.</p>
