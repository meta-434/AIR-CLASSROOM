1. Do not try and take matters into your own hands. The glass on the iPads is very fragile, and this will likely be the most common accident that happens.
2. Be very careful that the iPad does not come into contact with any moisture, as it could seep into the internals of the device.
3. Place the iPad back into its protective covering, and immediately contact our support number at 540-881-8561.
4. Refrain from using the device for the rest of your time in the classroom, a technicial will pick up the device once your session is over.
