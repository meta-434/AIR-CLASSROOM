About the project
* This project is a [WebHelp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_help)-styled documentation project.
  * Because the focus of this project was mastering the WebHelp format, the negatives of the format are not addressed.
  * Normally when I create documentation I make formats to be as accessible as possible to different platforms. However, the nature of WebHelp constrains me to internet-capable devices exclusively.
* The project task was to provide an online multi-user documentation source that would allow different audiences to access relevant information without weeding through information irrelevant to their interests. 
  * This project doesn't focus on filterable documentation, for an example of my work demonstrating muti-topic filtering, check out [this project](https://www.google.com).
